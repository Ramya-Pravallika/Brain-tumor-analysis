# Brain-tumor-analysis
MRI technology is used to identify brain cancers because MRI scans have great resolution and may clearly depict the structure, size, and location of brain tumours. BraTS 2015 dataset is used for brain tumor filtering, segmentation and classification.
# Filtering
Most of the MRI images consists of more noise to remove that noise we are using Median filtering and mean filtering algorithms. Both the filtering algorithms used to remove nnoise from an image but the quality of the image varies.
